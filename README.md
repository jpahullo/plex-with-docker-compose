# [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

This is the skeleton to run your Plex server into your computer.

## Advantages

1. No dependencies on your computer, just docker and docker-compose.
1. Easy installing on every hard disk, even on an external unit.
    * You can have the configuration and all the media on the external hard
      disk, as I do. When you want it to run, just start it with
      `docker-compose up` and let the magics happen.

## Disadvantages

1. You have the docker image of the Plex server still on your computer.

## Thanks

Thanks to [linuxserver.io](https://github.com/linuxserver) for maintaining such
a bunch of docker images to use everywhere, even at **home**.
